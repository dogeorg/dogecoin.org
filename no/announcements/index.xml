<p>We are happy to announce the institution of a new community Dogecoin Core development fund, managed by existing core developers and Dogecoin Foundation board director signatories, along with transparency blog posts forthcoming for all expenditures and developments.
The Dogecoin Foundation has taken the step of moving 5,000,000 Dogecoin to the development fund, with the intent that this will be allocated to Dogecoin Core, the development of which is critical and to the benefit of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is  a new, segregated multi-signature wallet, designed to transparently manage a sum of 5,000,000 DOGE. The DOGE held in this wallet will disburse rewards to developers of Dogecoin Core for work on all contributions, no matter how big or small.</p>
<p>This new multi-signature wallet will be operated by Dogecoin Core developers and members of the Dogecoin Foundation. The wallet is secured with a three out of five signature threshold, with the following custodians:</p>
<ul>
<li>chromatic (Dogecoin Core developer)</li>
<li>Marshall Hayner (Dogecoin Foundation Board)</li>
<li>Michi Lumin (Dogecoin Core developer, Dogecoin Foundation Board)</li>
<li>Patrick Lodder (Dogecoin Core developer)</li>
<li>Ross Nicoll (Former Dogecoin Core developer)</li>
</ul>
<p>The address can be found here:</p>
<h3 id="9xep9voinlw7y7ds87m8qrqkm43r6r5km5">9xEP9voiNLw7Y7DS87M8QRqKM43r6r5KM5</h3>
<p>The wallet shall operate as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>With every major or minor release of Dogecoin Core, 500,000 DOGE shall be distributed among all contributors credited in the release notes since the previous major or minor release, exclusively. A release must meet a threshold of at least 25 non-whitespace/comment-only pull requests to qualify as a major or minor release. These are the only permissible transfers out from this wallet.</li>
<li>The height of the payout for each individual contributor will be weighed based on the process used for the Dogecoin Core tip jar, to minimize duplication of work, or based thereon if no functional Dogecoin Core tip jar exists at that time.</li>
<li>Custodians do not have any rights to the money held in the wallet, individually or as a group.</li>
<li>All distributions shall be publicly announced and distributed widely across social media channels to the best of the abilities of the custodians.</li>
<li>A custodian can only request succession for their own slot but cannot nominate their successor. The remaining custodians shall publicly nominate a replacement and unanimously agree on the appointment of the successor. When this process is completed in full and a successor is appointed, the custodian is relieved of all duties.</li>
<li>If a custodian is unreachable without notice for a period of 3 months or more, the remaining custodians shall initiate a succession process under clause 5. The affected custodian shall be permitted to return to active duty until the succession process has been completed in full.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="welcome-marshall">Welcome Marshall!</h2>
<p>We would also like to welcome Marshall Hayner to the Dogecoin Foundation board of directors at this time, his consistent commitment to the Dogecoin community and the development of Dogecoin has inspired many. Marshall brings executive and technical leadership experience to the Dogecoin Foundation and has been instrumental in creating this Core development fund.</p>
<p>This Holiday Season the Dogecoin Foundation wants to send our warmest greetings to you and your family. We hope that you can find joy and cheer in celebrating with the ones you love and taking care of yourselves!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&ndash; The Dogecoin Foundation</p>

So what are bridges, and how do they affect everyday Shibes using Dogecoin?

<p>You may have heard talk about bridges in crypto, and recently in relation to Dogecoin.If you
search around online for bridges to any major blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum you’ll find plenty of them.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-are-bridges-and-how-do-they-affect-everyday-shibes-using-dogecoin">So what are bridges, and how do they affect everyday Shibes using Dogecoin?</h2>
<p>Much like a physical bridge connects two locations, a crypto bridge connects two blockchains together to allow interaction: usually to allow one coin to be used on the other side of the bridge.  Many of the bridges we see today are used to take a cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin or Bitcoin, and allow them to be used on a smart-contract blockchain such as Ethereum.</p>
<p>Bridges operate by providing a ‘wrapped token’ on the non-origin side, usually representing a 1-1 relationship between the ‘coin’ on the first chain, and the ‘token’ on the other.  In the case of Doge, this allows a Dogecoin holder to transfer some Dogecoin into a wallet controlled by the bridge: either via a custodian, or more ideally by a decentralised, automated smart-contract.</p>
<p><strong>You trade Doge to an entity which gives you an amount of ‘wrapped dogecoin’ on the foreign blockchain.</strong></p>
<p>The promise of these ‘wrapped tokens’ is that they allow participation in new financial activities not available on the original chain, such as the ability to loan Dogecoin to another person, or to transfer ownership of your wrapped dogecoin via a smart-contract, as would occur if you bought NFTs via a wrapped token.</p>
<h2 id="doge-ethereum-bridge-now-wdoge">Doge-Ethereum bridge, now wDoge.</h2>
<p>Back in 2017 Dogecoin developer Ross Nicoll and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the possibility of a Doge - Eth bridge, and a bounty was established by members of both communities to inspire the development of an effective, fair bridge between the two blockchains.</p>
<p>Since then Oscar Guindzberg and colleagues have been researching and developing the bridge with the aim of allowing Dogecoin to be integrated into the Ethereum smart-contract ecosystem in a safe and secure fashion.  Recently Oscar and co-founder Gabriel Reiter have established <a href="https://bluepepper.io">Blue Pepper</a>, a commercial startup to provide full time development focus on bridging the two chains with <a href="https://wdoge.tech">wDoge</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dogecoin-foundation-joining-the-wdoge-dao">Dogecoin Foundation joining the wDoge DAO.</h2>
<p>Blue Pepper has written about the <a href="https://medium.com/@bluepepper/doge-eth-bridge-past-present-and-future-89f7623bcab6">history of the bridge</a> and how it will function, and is in the process of establishing a DAO (decentralized autonomous organisation) of companies, non-profits and individuals from the Dogecoin community to govern the bridge protocol. The DAO will be responsible for governing via vote the means to upgrade the bridge’s smart-contracts and to add custodians or merchants.</p>
<p>Blue Pepper have provided a transparent and open approach to developing a pragmatic middle-ground as a stepping stone while they continue to research and develop greater decentralisation mechanisms for bridging Dogecoin and Ethereum, and it is for this reason the the Dogecoin Foundation have agreed to become a trusted key holder in the wDoge DAO as the next logical step in the bridge’s evolution.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As the Dogecoin ecosystem continues to expand and develop, transparent bridges built by recognised Shibes who are openly engaging with the community while building utility for Dogecoin will provide important building blocks for the future of decentralised financial systems.</p>
<p>These projects offer interesting opportunities for Dogecoin holders to make use of their Doge in new and novel ways, and through their wDoge project, Oscar, Gabriel and the Blue Pepper team are demonstrating how this can be achieved in an open and transparent manner.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to seeing what great things they can achieve.</p>

<p>G&rsquo;day shibes everywhere!</p>
<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is delighted to announce that registrations are now open for
the 2022 Dogeathon Downunder hackathon in sunny Australia (or online) kicking off on Nov 15th.</p>
<p><a href="https://dogecoin.com/dogeathon/">https://dogecoin.com/dogeathon/</a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re inviting devs of all skill levels to join us to #HackTheDoge with a 4 day hackathon involving
prizes, much fun, and adventure as we build the Dogecoin Ecosystem together!</p>
<p>Taking place in the Yarra Ranges, Australia, with online-participation available for global
participants, the Dogeathon will showcase the power of Dogecoin&rsquo;s new and old integration solutions - LibDogecoin,
GigaWallet API, Core API, Doge-Eth Bridge, &amp; more - as we BUIDL the future of the Peoples&rsquo; Cryptocurrency,
and increase the surface area of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Seven months ago, the Dogecoin Foundation’s Timothy Stebbing <a href="https://foundation.dogecoin.com/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/">outlined</a> the Foundation&rsquo;s
approach to promoting Dogecoin Development, through a strong focus on building the Dogecoin Ecosystem and increasing the number of developers
working on all things Dogecoin. This included highlighting some of the key drivers of the various projects that the Foundation is working on.</p>
<p>One of the Foundation’s primary goals has been to drastically expand what it means to be a ‘Dogecoin developer’, and champion projects that
lower the barrier for many new people to get involved at different levels: through libraries, documentation, mentoring, and community
engagement. Essentially, foster a ‘Dogecoin developer ecosystem’ of hundreds of new people so the #DogeDevArmy is strong, spread across
many projects.</p>
<p>The first Foundation projects - Libdogecoin (Dogecoin C library) and GigaWallet (payment service) - are key stepping stones toward making
this goal a reality. As we&rsquo;ve begun to see the fruits of these labors with the first release of Libdogecoin - and many devs wrapping
and using the library from different languages - we want to take the opportunity to see what amazing new things folk can build using these
and other tools. <em>Enter the Dogeathon!</em></p>
<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is aiming for the Dogeathon Downunder 2022 to set the stage for a more significant CampDoge Conference in 2023 and
beyond, which will be held in different locations around the globe every year in the service of promoting Dogecoin development in the future.</p>
<p>The event will feature both Community and Prize Awards, the latter being judged by an esteemed panel of Dogecoin champions! The current Prize
pool starts at <strong>Ð 200,069.00</strong>, and Shibes can tip the Prize Pool address to increase the award. Judges will be announced soon. Much wow.</p>

<p>After putting out the call for volunteers on Reddit and Twitter we gathered a
group of around 20 Shibes with a wide variety of talents: from writing and
translation, to HTML, CSS and graphic design.</p>
<p>Since then the team, beginning with foundation.dogecoin.com developed a
system for publishing, translating and maintaining websites for the Dogecoin
community. The next step was to apply that system to a full re-design of the
dogecoin.com site.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="previewdogecoincom">preview.dogecoin.com</h3>
<img class="dogegoin-light" src="/website-redesign.png" alt="Dogecoin Website">
<p>Today we would love to welcome community feedback on the preview of the new
website, which you can see at <a href="https://preview.dogecoin.com">preview.dogecoin.com</a></p>
<p>The translations are not all in place yet and there are some minor mobile issues,
however we&rsquo;re excited to get this out as a preview for a two week period to let
folk have a read through the &ldquo;Dogepedia&rdquo; articles, make suggestions via the <a href="https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation/dogecoin.com/issues">GitHub issues</a>
system or even get involved.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re keen to be part of the website team reach out to Paulo (Inevitable360)
for an invitation to the Discord server and the GitHub project.  You will need to
work with <em>git</em> and <em>markdown</em> however we&rsquo;ve got some great community members who
are available to help explain the process.</p>
<p>A huge shout-out to all the people who have made this possible:</p>
<p>CB, Belle, Bluezr, Ella, Florian, Ishan, Sam, Michi, Misha, Paulo, Richard, Tim,
Florian, Mishaboar, Dogememegirl, Adi, Doge Norway, Doge France, Bobdos, BeanieFi,

Rasoul, Yamazaki .. and anyone else we&rsquo;ve missed! Thank you!</p>
<p>&ndash; The Web Team</p>
<p>PS: You might be wondering where the developer focused content is, links to GitHub, how
to get involved etc.. we&rsquo;ve actually secured the dogecoin.org domain and will be
looking at how we can best use that as a &lsquo;Dogecoin Developer Portal&rsquo; to accompany
dogecoin.com as the &lsquo;Dogecoin User Portal&rsquo;.</p>

<p>While this is news to many in the community, Ross had made his intentions clear to
the Core developers almost a year ago and has been working quietly behind the scenes

<p>With this in mind, Ross has been instrumental in the re-establishment of the Dogecoin

into the future through a diverse ecosystem of projects and teams, working in
collaboration toward making Dogecoin a long-term sustainable cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>While this may be seen as a loss for the Dogecoin Community, we believe that Ross&rsquo;
ongoing involvement as an Advisor will free him up to play more of an advocacy role.
On behalf of the Dogecoin Foundation and the wider Dogecoin community, we salute Ross
for his tireless work on maintaining the Dogecoin dream for most of the last decade.</p>
<p>We will miss the top hat, the easy going British humour, and the boundless wisdom in

its reputation, and the global community of Shibes. The Foundation is committed to ensuring that
Dogecoin continues to thrive, and can ultimately scale to being a widely used currency whilst
simultaneously tackling changes at a pace that keeps-up with other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>On January 23rd, 2022, three members of the Foundation, Michi Lumin, Ross Nicoll, and Tim Stebbing
will be participating in a video AMA (Ask-Me-Anything) with the community. The AMA will be live
streamed <a href="https://youtu.be/jctze9jZfTQ">here</a>. In anticipation of the AMA, a short update of recent Foundation
activities, all of which have been undertaken for the benefit of the Dogecoin community, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launching the first <a href="/trailmap/prologue/">Dogecoin Trailmap</a> to provide a vision for the future of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging with and consulting several potential commercial and non-commercial users of the GigaWallet project, gathering requirements and breaking ground on development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gathering a like-minded group of developers from the community interested in contributing to the Libdogecoin project and commencing development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a team of community website and translation volunteers who are working diligently on the upcoming dogecoin.com website and the ‘Dogepedia’ in multiple languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-boarding long-term and previously unpaid volunteers in key functions, treating those individuals fairly and ensuring that the Dogecoin ecosystem can be resourced consistently in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing good governance and compliance principles, working with legal, accounting, and tax advisors to ensure proper use of any Foundation funds only for the benefit of the Dogecoin community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting and promoting the use of Dogecoin for important charitable causes, for example with <a href="https://dogecoin.com/teamseas/">#TeamSeas</a>, helping remove more than 30,000,000 pounds of trash from the oceans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started collaborating with non-profits that share Dogecoin’s spirit of playful discovery and learning such as <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preventing hostile parties (including large corporates) from taking over or claiming ownership of Dogecoin through, e.g., bad faith trademark registrations; or to mislead the community by pretending to be Dogecoin or be affiliated with it. For example, please see our recent tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/DogecoinFdn/status/1484474892569305088?s=20">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that the Dogecoin name, logo, and memes remain available for the community to use freely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Liaising with the community, investors, technologists and other stakeholders around the world, to devise and implement opportunities for the cryptocurrency, to future-proof it for everyone.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, all of these actions have been taken to ensure that Dogecoin remains the People’s
cryptocurrency for years to come. The Foundation is dedicated, as always, to <strong>D</strong>oing <strong>O</strong>nly <strong>G</strong>ood <strong>E</strong>veryday.
The Foundation is currently putting together a note which will provide more detail regarding the Foundation’s
strategy, funding, and Tip Jar transactions. We look forward to sharing this information with you in the coming weeks.</p>

<h3 id="focus">Focus</h3>
<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is not here to ‘take control’ of the <em>Dogecoin Core Wallet</em> project, which remains the primary reference implementation of a compliant Dogecoin Wallet. We are here to accelerate the development effort by supporting current Dogecoin Core and future Dogecoin Developers to work on a full-time basis through sponsorship, as well as providing a welcome landing for new contributors hoping to help with the project.</p>
<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is also looking to the future of the broader Dogecoin ecosystem, and in coming weeks, will be announcing new projects that will compliment the current Core Wallet to enable faster integration and easier APIs for Financial, Social and Charitable projects wishing to use Dogecoin. We believe that the success of Dogecoin is through broad global adoption and utility, and intend to focus on projects that increase Dogecoin uptake at a grassroots level.</p>
<h3 id="protecting-the-dogecoin-brand">Protecting the Dogecoin Brand</h3>
<p>For many years, the Dogecoin community has continued to think the best of people and hoped that everyone could play nicely with the name and logos. Dogecoin belongs to the people after all.</p>
<p>However, in recent times, numerous attempts have been made to co-opt the &lsquo;Dogecoin&rsquo; brand in various jurisdictions, in ways that would prevent the community and the project itself using them.</p>
<p>Not many people know this, but we would like to commend one Very Good Shibe: Jens Wiechers, who since 2014 has single-handedly and at great personal expense fought these kinds of attacks through the trademark office under the banner of the Dogecoin Foundation to protect everyone’s right to use the Dogecoin brand.</p>
<p>The Foundation holds the Dogecoin mark and the Dogecoin Logo and will maintain them for the community. This will mean the Foundation can continue to protect the Dogecoin Brand and allow (under a very liberal license) the ability to use it for Dogecoin-related memes, projects and fun. — We’ve got your back on this one.</p>
<h3 id="the-dogecoin-manifesto">The Dogecoin Manifesto</h3>
<p>We have been thinking about what Dogecoin means: as a technical project and as a movement for good in the world. We’ve condensed it down to four statements that we are calling the Dogecoin Manifesto. Two are technically-focused and two are social.</p>
<p>We believe that together, these key pillars that embody ‘Do Only Good Everyday’ will guide us forward as we make decisions and advance the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="/manifesto">The Dogecoin Manifesto</a></p>
<p>If you can, please ‘sign’ the Manifesto by clicking the tweet link at the bottom of the Manifesto page. This will let the world know what the Doge Army stands for!</p>
<h3 id="stop-collaborate-and-listen">Stop, collaborate and listen!</h3>
<p>One of the key tenets of the Manifesto is that we value <em>collaboration and trust</em> over <em>competition and exclusivity</em>. With that in mind, we have established a small, but intensely smart and amazing group of Advisors with experience in a range of areas who will be allies and advocates for Dogecoin as we seek to grow and develop the ecosystem.</p>
<p><a href="/about">Head on over and check out our amaze Advisors list</a>, and be sure to give them some love for offering their valuable time.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-success">The cost of success</h3>
<p>The Foundation re-launches with the help of many volunteers who have been working tirelessly over the past several months. We recognise, however, that Dogecoin (at time of writing a 44 billion dollar financial product) has grown in size beyond many organisations with thousands of employees.</p>
<p>It has come to the point that many of the people who have been working non-stop to make Dogecoin what it is today whilst holding down full-time day jobs have been burning out and struggling to deal with the flood of attention (good and bad) that Dogecoin has been receiving.</p>
<p>This comes at a cost. Talented new people come to the project hoping to help and there is no one to welcome them or help them find a way to contribute and so they leave frustrated. The documentation effort has stalled and potential patches sit un-reviewed while the limited time a small core of people have is focused on critical issues.</p>
<h3 id="sponsorship">Sponsorship</h3>
<p>We believe Dogecoin deserves the attention of a team of full-time contributors who can help carry the burden of these more mundane tasks that keep the Dogecoin project alive.</p>
<p>The Foundation has been preparing a budget and has received expressions of interest from a number of people who are able to contribute. We aim to build a group of annual sponsors who can cover Foundation activities and a modest development team.</p>
<p>Our Initial target is to secure a three-year budget so that we can on-board a minimum staff to improve Dogecoin full-time, without them having to worry about job security.</p>
<p>If you are in a position to support the Dogecoin Foundation through major sponsorship please reach out, we’d love to speak with you.</p>
<p></br></br>
Much love,  — The Dogecoin Foundation
