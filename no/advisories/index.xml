<p>Binance has today paused Dogecoin withdrawals and stated they have found a &ldquo;minor issue&rdquo; in Dogecoin. The Foundation wishes to address this:</p>
<p>Several months ago (noting while an earlier post stated a year, first confirmed mention is April) Binance notified a group of Dogecoin Core maintainers that Binance had cases where transactions were stuck, meaning the transactions were not being mined successfully. The maintainers suggested Binance use RBF (replace by fee) on these transactions, which would replace the original transactions with a new transaction with a higher fee paid. Notably this was suggested because replace by fee invalidates the previous transaction (hence &ldquo;replace&rdquo;). As the transaction had RBF disabled, it was recommended that Binance create a new transaction manually, which would consume the same inputs to forcibly invalidate the previous transaction.</p>
<p>Some time later Binance notified the maintainers that they had account reconciliation issues. The maintainers were unable to reproduce those issues with the data we were given by Binance, but at the time suggested using the <code>-zapwallettxes</code> command line option to mitigate the issue. This is notable as it is anticipated this would have also prevented the issue seen.</p>
<p>Yesterday November 10th Binance notified the maintainers that previously stuck transactions had suddenly relayed successfully, post 1.14.5 update; likely because minfees have been lowered in 1.14.5, making the previously valid but unrelayable transactions relayable. The sole example provided is a transaction with fees which are valid as of v1.14.5, but were invalid (too low) in 1.14.3 and before. Note, Binance updated directly from v1.14.3 to 1.14.5, in the past few days.</p>
<p>Based on the information available it appears that the previously stuck transactions have been retried automatically, as would happen on each node restart after upgrade - and went through, since now the minimum required relay fee is lower. This is correct behaviour as a result of reducing fees.</p>
<h2 id="lessons">Lessons</h2>
<ul>
<li>Correct handling to cancel a transaction is to spend the to-be-cancelled transaction&rsquo;s inputs to a different transaction, which invalidates the first.
<ul>
<li>Ideally use replace-by-fee if available, but otherwise crafting and sending a transaction spending the previously chosen inputs, will invalidate the previous transaction.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Please note that transactions don&rsquo;t have a defined timeout period, but are typically discarded due to memory limits.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="guidance">Guidance</h2>
<p>The Foundation has received no further reports of this happening. For any providers with concerns about stagnant invalid transactions, we recommend stopping the nodes, removing the mempool.dat file just in case, and then starting the node with <code>-zapwallettxes</code>.</p>
<p>For individual users with concerns, note that sending all of your Dogecoins back to yourself (ideally a new address, but you can use an existing one for this) will also spend any previous transaction outputs, and invalidate any such &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; transactions.</p>

<p>As always, the Dogecoin Foundation welcomes newcomers to the crypto space but this project has no connection to or
relationship with Dogecoin.  To protect the Dogecoin community from being misled and to protect the Dogecoin name
from possible misuse we have asked our brand protection lawyers to contact the developers of the &lsquo;Dogecoin 2.0&rsquo;
product.</p>
<p>We hope our reasonable request will see their development team select a new name for their project which does not
infringe on the rights and reputation of the Dogecoin project, and we look forward to any innovations they may make
in their future endeavours.</p>

<p>Som sådan ser det ut til at ethvert krav om &ldquo;samarbeid og tilknytting&rdquo; er utformet for å skape et misvisende bilde av samarbeid og tilknytning til det etablerte Dogecoin-prosjektet og Dogecoin Foundation.</p>
<p>Vi bør også merke oss at selskapet MoonRabbit AngoZaibatsu aktivt prøver å registrere et varemerke for &ldquo;Dogecoin&rdquo; -navnet i både Europa og USA. Dogecoin -prosjektet og Dogecoin -stiftelsen er aktivt i gang med å motsette seg disse og andre forsøk på å registrere slike varemerker med den begrunnelse at disse enhetene ikke har noen tilknytning til Dogecoin og  urettmessig prøver å tjene på den goodwill Dogecoin har oppbygget seg over siden oppstarten.</p>
<p>Vær trygg på at vi gjør alle nødvendige undersøkelser for å finne ut av fakta i denne saken fortløpende. For å unngå tvil bør henvendelser rettes til medlemmer av Dogecoin -prosjektet, Dogecoin Core -utviklerne og Dogecoin Foundation bare gjennom kanaler som er oppført på enten <a href="https://dogecoin.com/">dogecoin.com</a> eller <a href="https://foundation.dogecoin.com/">foundation.dogecoin.com</a> og ikke via annen e -post, sosiale medier eller nettsted som påstås å være tilknyttet Dogecoin.</p>
