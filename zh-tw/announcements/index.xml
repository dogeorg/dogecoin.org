<p>We are happy to announce the institution of a new community Dogecoin Core development fund, managed by existing core developers and Dogecoin Foundation board director signatories, along with transparency blog posts forthcoming for all expenditures and developments.
The Dogecoin Foundation has taken the step of moving 5,000,000 Dogecoin to the development fund, with the intent that this will be allocated to Dogecoin Core, the development of which is critical and to the benefit of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
<p>This is  a new, segregated multi-signature wallet, designed to transparently manage a sum of 5,000,000 DOGE. The DOGE held in this wallet will disburse rewards to developers of Dogecoin Core for work on all contributions, no matter how big or small.</p>
<p>This new multi-signature wallet will be operated by Dogecoin Core developers and members of the Dogecoin Foundation. The wallet is secured with a three out of five signature threshold, with the following custodians:</p>
<ul>
<li>chromatic (Dogecoin Core developer)</li>
<li>Marshall Hayner (Dogecoin Foundation Board)</li>
<li>Michi Lumin (Dogecoin Core developer, Dogecoin Foundation Board)</li>
<li>Patrick Lodder (Dogecoin Core developer)</li>
<li>Ross Nicoll (Former Dogecoin Core developer)</li>
</ul>
<p>The address can be found here:</p>
<h3 id="9xep9voinlw7y7ds87m8qrqkm43r6r5km5">9xEP9voiNLw7Y7DS87M8QRqKM43r6r5KM5</h3>
<p>The wallet shall operate as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>With every major or minor release of Dogecoin Core, 500,000 DOGE shall be distributed among all contributors credited in the release notes since the previous major or minor release, exclusively. A release must meet a threshold of at least 25 non-whitespace/comment-only pull requests to qualify as a major or minor release. These are the only permissible transfers out from this wallet.</li>
<li>The height of the payout for each individual contributor will be weighed based on the process used for the Dogecoin Core tip jar, to minimize duplication of work, or based thereon if no functional Dogecoin Core tip jar exists at that time.</li>
<li>Custodians do not have any rights to the money held in the wallet, individually or as a group.</li>
<li>All distributions shall be publicly announced and distributed widely across social media channels to the best of the abilities of the custodians.</li>
<li>A custodian can only request succession for their own slot but cannot nominate their successor. The remaining custodians shall publicly nominate a replacement and unanimously agree on the appointment of the successor. When this process is completed in full and a successor is appointed, the custodian is relieved of all duties.</li>
<li>If a custodian is unreachable without notice for a period of 3 months or more, the remaining custodians shall initiate a succession process under clause 5. The affected custodian shall be permitted to return to active duty until the succession process has been completed in full.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="welcome-marshall">Welcome Marshall!</h2>
<p>We would also like to welcome Marshall Hayner to the Dogecoin Foundation board of directors at this time, his consistent commitment to the Dogecoin community and the development of Dogecoin has inspired many. Marshall brings executive and technical leadership experience to the Dogecoin Foundation and has been instrumental in creating this Core development fund.</p>
<p>This Holiday Season the Dogecoin Foundation wants to send our warmest greetings to you and your family. We hope that you can find joy and cheer in celebrating with the ones you love and taking care of yourselves!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>&ndash; The Dogecoin Foundation</p>

<p>You may have heard talk about bridges in crypto, and recently in relation to Dogecoin.If you
search around online for bridges to any major blockchain such as Bitcoin or Ethereum you’ll find plenty of them.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-are-bridges-and-how-do-they-affect-everyday-shibes-using-dogecoin">So what are bridges, and how do they affect everyday Shibes using Dogecoin?</h2>
<p>Much like a physical bridge connects two locations, a crypto bridge connects two blockchains together to allow interaction: usually to allow one coin to be used on the other side of the bridge.  Many of the bridges we see today are used to take a cryptocurrency such as Dogecoin or Bitcoin, and allow them to be used on a smart-contract blockchain such as Ethereum.</p>
<p>Bridges operate by providing a ‘wrapped token’ on the non-origin side, usually representing a 1-1 relationship between the ‘coin’ on the first chain, and the ‘token’ on the other.  In the case of Doge, this allows a Dogecoin holder to transfer some Dogecoin into a wallet controlled by the bridge: either via a custodian, or more ideally by a decentralised, automated smart-contract.</p>
<p><strong>You trade Doge to an entity which gives you an amount of ‘wrapped dogecoin’ on the foreign blockchain.</strong></p>
<p>The promise of these ‘wrapped tokens’ is that they allow participation in new financial activities not available on the original chain, such as the ability to loan Dogecoin to another person, or to transfer ownership of your wrapped dogecoin via a smart-contract, as would occur if you bought NFTs via a wrapped token.</p>
<h2 id="doge-ethereum-bridge-now-wdoge">Doge-Ethereum bridge, now wDoge.</h2>
<p>Back in 2017 Dogecoin developer Ross Nicoll and Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin discussed the possibility of a Doge - Eth bridge, and a bounty was established by members of both communities to inspire the development of an effective, fair bridge between the two blockchains.</p>
<p>Since then Oscar Guindzberg and colleagues have been researching and developing the bridge with the aim of allowing Dogecoin to be integrated into the Ethereum smart-contract ecosystem in a safe and secure fashion.  Recently Oscar and co-founder Gabriel Reiter have established <a href="https://bluepepper.io">Blue Pepper</a>, a commercial startup to provide full time development focus on bridging the two chains with <a href="https://wdoge.tech">wDoge</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dogecoin-foundation-joining-the-wdoge-dao">Dogecoin Foundation joining the wDoge DAO.</h2>
<p>Blue Pepper has written about the <a href="https://medium.com/@bluepepper/doge-eth-bridge-past-present-and-future-89f7623bcab6">history of the bridge</a> and how it will function, and is in the process of establishing a DAO (decentralized autonomous organisation) of companies, non-profits and individuals from the Dogecoin community to govern the bridge protocol. The DAO will be responsible for governing via vote the means to upgrade the bridge’s smart-contracts and to add custodians or merchants.</p>
<p>Blue Pepper have provided a transparent and open approach to developing a pragmatic middle-ground as a stepping stone while they continue to research and develop greater decentralisation mechanisms for bridging Dogecoin and Ethereum, and it is for this reason the the Dogecoin Foundation have agreed to become a trusted key holder in the wDoge DAO as the next logical step in the bridge’s evolution.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As the Dogecoin ecosystem continues to expand and develop, transparent bridges built by recognised Shibes who are openly engaging with the community while building utility for Dogecoin will provide important building blocks for the future of decentralised financial systems.</p>
<p>These projects offer interesting opportunities for Dogecoin holders to make use of their Doge in new and novel ways, and through their wDoge project, Oscar, Gabriel and the Blue Pepper team are demonstrating how this can be achieved in an open and transparent manner.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to seeing what great things they can achieve.</p>

<p>G&rsquo;day shibes everywhere!</p>
<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is delighted to announce that registrations are now open for
the 2022 Dogeathon Downunder hackathon in sunny Australia (or online) kicking off on Nov 15th.</p>
<p><a href="https://dogecoin.com/dogeathon/">https://dogecoin.com/dogeathon/</a></p>
<p>We&rsquo;re inviting devs of all skill levels to join us to #HackTheDoge with a 4 day hackathon involving
prizes, much fun, and adventure as we build the Dogecoin Ecosystem together!</p>
<p>Taking place in the Yarra Ranges, Australia, with online-participation available for global
participants, the Dogeathon will showcase the power of Dogecoin&rsquo;s new and old integration solutions - LibDogecoin,
GigaWallet API, Core API, Doge-Eth Bridge, &amp; more - as we BUIDL the future of the Peoples&rsquo; Cryptocurrency,
and increase the surface area of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>Seven months ago, the Dogecoin Foundation’s Timothy Stebbing <a href="https://foundation.dogecoin.com/blog/2022-02-15-tjstebbing/">outlined</a> the Foundation&rsquo;s
approach to promoting Dogecoin Development, through a strong focus on building the Dogecoin Ecosystem and increasing the number of developers
working on all things Dogecoin. This included highlighting some of the key drivers of the various projects that the Foundation is working on.</p>
<p>One of the Foundation’s primary goals has been to drastically expand what it means to be a ‘Dogecoin developer’, and champion projects that
lower the barrier for many new people to get involved at different levels: through libraries, documentation, mentoring, and community
engagement. Essentially, foster a ‘Dogecoin developer ecosystem’ of hundreds of new people so the #DogeDevArmy is strong, spread across
many projects.</p>
<p>The first Foundation projects - Libdogecoin (Dogecoin C library) and GigaWallet (payment service) - are key stepping stones toward making
this goal a reality. As we&rsquo;ve begun to see the fruits of these labors with the first release of Libdogecoin - and many devs wrapping
and using the library from different languages - we want to take the opportunity to see what amazing new things folk can build using these
and other tools. <em>Enter the Dogeathon!</em></p>
<p>The Dogecoin Foundation is aiming for the Dogeathon Downunder 2022 to set the stage for a more significant CampDoge Conference in 2023 and
beyond, which will be held in different locations around the globe every year in the service of promoting Dogecoin development in the future.</p>
<p>The event will feature both Community and Prize Awards, the latter being judged by an esteemed panel of Dogecoin champions! The current Prize
pool starts at <strong>Ð 200,069.00</strong>, and Shibes can tip the Prize Pool address to increase the award. Judges will be announced soon. Much wow.</p>

<p>After putting out the call for volunteers on Reddit and Twitter we gathered a
group of around 20 Shibes with a wide variety of talents: from writing and
translation, to HTML, CSS and graphic design.</p>
<p>Since then the team, beginning with foundation.dogecoin.com developed a
system for publishing, translating and maintaining websites for the Dogecoin
community. The next step was to apply that system to a full re-design of the
dogecoin.com site.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="previewdogecoincom">preview.dogecoin.com</h3>
<img class="dogegoin-light" src="/website-redesign.png" alt="Dogecoin Website">
<p>Today we would love to welcome community feedback on the preview of the new
website, which you can see at <a href="https://preview.dogecoin.com">preview.dogecoin.com</a></p>
<p>The translations are not all in place yet and there are some minor mobile issues,
however we&rsquo;re excited to get this out as a preview for a two week period to let
folk have a read through the &ldquo;Dogepedia&rdquo; articles, make suggestions via the <a href="https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation/dogecoin.com/issues">GitHub issues</a>
system or even get involved.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re keen to be part of the website team reach out to Paulo (Inevitable360)
for an invitation to the Discord server and the GitHub project.  You will need to
work with <em>git</em> and <em>markdown</em> however we&rsquo;ve got some great community members who
are available to help explain the process.</p>
<p>A huge shout-out to all the people who have made this possible:</p>
<p>CB, Belle, Bluezr, Ella, Florian, Ishan, Sam, Michi, Misha, Paulo, Richard, Tim,
Florian, Mishaboar, Dogememegirl, Adi, Doge Norway, Doge France, Bobdos, BeanieFi,

Rasoul, Yamazaki .. and anyone else we&rsquo;ve missed! Thank you!</p>
<p>&ndash; The Web Team</p>
<p>PS: You might be wondering where the developer focused content is, links to GitHub, how
to get involved etc.. we&rsquo;ve actually secured the dogecoin.org domain and will be
looking at how we can best use that as a &lsquo;Dogecoin Developer Portal&rsquo; to accompany
dogecoin.com as the &lsquo;Dogecoin User Portal&rsquo;.</p>

<p>While this is news to many in the community, Ross had made his intentions clear to
the Core developers almost a year ago and has been working quietly behind the scenes
to create a sustainable transition for his role in the Dogecoin project.</p>
<p>With this in mind, Ross has been instrumental in the re-establishment of the Dogecoin

into the future through a diverse ecosystem of projects and teams, working in
collaboration toward making Dogecoin a long-term sustainable cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>While this may be seen as a loss for the Dogecoin Community, we believe that Ross&rsquo;
ongoing involvement as an Advisor will free him up to play more of an advocacy role.
On behalf of the Dogecoin Foundation and the wider Dogecoin community, we salute Ross
for his tireless work on maintaining the Dogecoin dream for most of the last decade.</p>
<p>We will miss the top hat, the easy going British humour, and the boundless wisdom in
our day-to-day interactions, and we wish Ross a bright and happy future as he continues

will be participating in a video AMA (Ask-Me-Anything) with the community. The AMA will be live
streamed <a href="https://youtu.be/jctze9jZfTQ">here</a>. In anticipation of the AMA, a short update of recent Foundation
activities, all of which have been undertaken for the benefit of the Dogecoin community, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Launching the first <a href="/trailmap/prologue/">Dogecoin Trailmap</a> to provide a vision for the future of the Dogecoin ecosystem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engaging with and consulting several potential commercial and non-commercial users of the GigaWallet project, gathering requirements and breaking ground on development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gathering a like-minded group of developers from the community interested in contributing to the Libdogecoin project and commencing development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing a team of community website and translation volunteers who are working diligently on the upcoming dogecoin.com website and the ‘Dogepedia’ in multiple languages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On-boarding long-term and previously unpaid volunteers in key functions, treating those individuals fairly and ensuring that the Dogecoin ecosystem can be resourced consistently in the future.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing good governance and compliance principles, working with legal, accounting, and tax advisors to ensure proper use of any Foundation funds only for the benefit of the Dogecoin community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Supporting and promoting the use of Dogecoin for important charitable causes, for example with <a href="https://dogecoin.com/teamseas/">#TeamSeas</a>, helping remove more than 30,000,000 pounds of trash from the oceans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Started collaborating with non-profits that share Dogecoin’s spirit of playful discovery and learning such as <a href="https://hackclub.com/">Hack Club</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preventing hostile parties (including large corporates) from taking over or claiming ownership of Dogecoin through, e.g., bad faith trademark registrations; or to mislead the community by pretending to be Dogecoin or be affiliated with it. For example, please see our recent tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/DogecoinFdn/status/1484474892569305088?s=20">here</a></p>
</li>
<li>

焦點 狗狗幣核心錢包（Dogecoin Core Wallet） 目前仍是符合規範的狗狗幣錢包之首要參考實現（Reference implementation）。狗狗幣基金會的存在並不是為了「掌控」這個專案。我們的成立是為了加速開發工作，對目前狗狗幣核心專案以及未來的開發者們提供贊助，希望他們能全職投入，同時也歡迎想協助專案的新進貢獻者。
基金會也展望狗狗幣生態系在未來更加拓展、廣泛。幾周內我們將宣布一個向核心錢包致敬的新專案，它將對想要使用狗狗幣的金融、社交和慈善專案提供更容易使用的 API，以及更快速的整合方案。我們相信藉由全球的廣泛使用方能達成狗狗幣的成功，並將專注於能從根本提升狗狗幣採用率的基礎專案。
保護狗狗幣商標 多年以來，狗狗幣社群秉持對人們的信任，希望所有人都能自由使用狗狗幣的名稱和標誌。畢竟狗狗幣本是屬於人民的。
然而，近來有許多人企圖在多個國家與地區將狗狗幣商標納為私有，這可能使狗狗幣專案和社群無法繼續使用它。
這是個鮮為人知的故事，但我們想在此表揚社群中一隻非常棒的狗狗（Shibe）：Jens Wiechers，他從 2014 年起就代表狗狗幣基金會，透過專利商標事務所與這些惡意行為對抗，獨力作戰並獨自吸收了許多支出，捍衛每個人使用狗狗幣商標的權利。
基金會現擁有狗狗幣商標與品牌標誌，並將為社群維護它們。這代表基金會能繼續保護狗狗幣品牌，且允許人們（於非常自由的授權下）在相關的迷因、專案與各種有趣的事物上使用此商標 — 在這件事情上我們會挺你。
狗狗幣宣言 我們一直都在思考狗狗幣的意義：它是一個技術專案，同時也是一場帶給世界正向影響的運動。我們將它濃縮成四項聲明，並稱之為狗狗幣宣言。其中兩項專注於技術，另外兩項則與社群相關。
我們相信，這些體現「日日向善（Do Only Good Everyday）」的關鍵精神，會在我們制定決策、推進狗狗幣生態系發展時引領我們前進。
狗狗幣宣言
如果可以，請使用宣言頁面底部的推特連結簽署這份宣言。這將讓世界知道我們狗狗大軍（DogeArmy）代表的意義！
停一停、合作並傾聽！ 宣言的其中一項重要宗旨，是我們重視 合作與信任 更甚於 競爭與排外。秉持這樣的信念，我們建立了一個精實、非常睿智且令人讚嘆的顧問小組，成員來自數個不同領域，在我們尋求狗狗幣生態系的發展時更能相互支持。
看看我們令人驚豔的顧問團隊名單，請一定要為他們喝采，感謝他們付出的寶貴時間。
成功的代價 眾多志願者在過去幾個月裡孜孜不倦地努力，使基金會得以重建。然而我們也意識到，狗狗幣（在撰文當下，它是價值 440 億美元的金融產品）已經成長至數千人的企業那樣的規模。
許多人勤勉不懈地付出，使狗狗幣達到今日的成就，但他們同時也需要自己的正職工作，這讓他們相當疲憊，並且必須花費極大心力來應對狗狗幣受到的大量（好的與壞的）關注。
這造成的代價是：才華洋溢的新面孔們來到這裡希望對此專案提供協助，但沒人有餘力來歡迎他們，或幫他們找到貢獻的方式，於是他們受挫地離開了。文件的進度停滯、補丁尚未被檢閱，團隊人力有限，僅能將有限的時間優先用於處理重大問題。
贊助 我們相信狗狗幣專案值得一支能負擔這些繁重瑣碎任務的全職團隊，以幫助專案持續活躍下去。
基金會已正在準備預算，並且已經收到一些貢獻者的合作意向。我們計劃建立一個能負擔基金會行動支出以及開發成本的年度贊助商團隊。
我們的初始目標是確保有足夠三年的預算，使最低人手編制的人員可以全職地為狗狗幣專案貢獻，而不用擔心生計。
如果你願意支持狗狗幣基金會、有能力成為我們的主力贊助商，請與我們聯繫，我們很樂意與你聊聊。
滿滿的愛，
— 狗狗幣基金會</description><content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>今天我們非常興奮地宣布<strong>狗狗幣基金會</strong>重組的消息 <em>（原創立於 2014 年）</em>。新的重點工作將放在對狗狗幣生態系和社群的支持，以及促進狗狗幣區塊鏈的未來發展。</p>

<p>基金會也展望狗狗幣生態系在未來更加拓展、廣泛。幾周內我們將宣布一個向核心錢包致敬的新專案，它將對想要使用狗狗幣的金融、社交和慈善專案提供更容易使用的 API，以及更快速的整合方案。我們相信藉由全球的廣泛使用方能達成狗狗幣的成功，並將專注於能從根本提升狗狗幣採用率的基礎專案。</p>
<h3 id="保護狗狗幣商標">保護狗狗幣商標</h3>
<p>多年以來，狗狗幣社群秉持對人們的信任，希望所有人都能自由使用狗狗幣的名稱和標誌。畢竟狗狗幣本是屬於人民的。</p>
<p>然而，近來有許多人企圖在多個國家與地區將狗狗幣商標納為私有，這可能使狗狗幣專案和社群無法繼續使用它。</p>
<p>這是個鮮為人知的故事，但我們想在此表揚社群中一隻非常棒的狗狗（Shibe）：Jens Wiechers，他從 2014 年起就代表狗狗幣基金會，透過專利商標事務所與這些惡意行為對抗，獨力作戰並獨自吸收了許多支出，捍衛每個人使用狗狗幣商標的權利。</p>
<p>基金會現擁有狗狗幣商標與品牌標誌，並將為社群維護它們。這代表基金會能繼續保護狗狗幣品牌，且允許人們（於非常自由的授權下）在相關的迷因、專案與各種有趣的事物上使用此商標 — 在這件事情上我們會挺你。</p>
<h3 id="狗狗幣宣言">狗狗幣宣言</h3>
<p>我們一直都在思考狗狗幣的意義：它是一個技術專案，同時也是一場帶給世界正向影響的運動。我們將它濃縮成四項聲明，並稱之為狗狗幣宣言。其中兩項專注於技術，另外兩項則與社群相關。</p>
<p>我們相信，這些體現「日日向善（Do Only Good Everyday）」的關鍵精神，會在我們制定決策、推進狗狗幣生態系發展時引領我們前進。</p>
<p><a href="/zh-tw/manifesto">狗狗幣宣言</a></p>
<p>如果可以，請使用宣言頁面底部的推特連結簽署這份宣言。這將讓世界知道我們狗狗大軍（DogeArmy）代表的意義！</p>
<h3 id="停一停合作並傾聽">停一停、合作並傾聽！</h3>
<p>宣言的其中一項重要宗旨，是我們重視 <em>合作與信任</em> 更甚於 <em>競爭與排外</em>。秉持這樣的信念，我們建立了一個精實、非常睿智且令人讚嘆的顧問小組，成員來自數個不同領域，在我們尋求狗狗幣生態系的發展時更能相互支持。</p>
<p><a href="/zh-tw/about">看看我們令人驚豔的顧問團隊名單</a>，請一定要為他們喝采，感謝他們付出的寶貴時間。</p>
<h3 id="成功的代價">成功的代價</h3>
<p>眾多志願者在過去幾個月裡孜孜不倦地努力，使基金會得以重建。然而我們也意識到，狗狗幣（在撰文當下，它是價值 440 億美元的金融產品）已經成長至數千人的企業那樣的規模。</p>
<p>許多人勤勉不懈地付出，使狗狗幣達到今日的成就，但他們同時也需要自己的正職工作，這讓他們相當疲憊，並且必須花費極大心力來應對狗狗幣受到的大量（好的與壞的）關注。</p>
<p>這造成的代價是：才華洋溢的新面孔們來到這裡希望對此專案提供協助，但沒人有餘力來歡迎他們，或幫他們找到貢獻的方式，於是他們受挫地離開了。文件的進度停滯、補丁尚未被檢閱，團隊人力有限，僅能將有限的時間優先用於處理重大問題。</p>
<h3 id="贊助">贊助</h3>
<p>我們相信狗狗幣專案值得一支能負擔這些繁重瑣碎任務的全職團隊，以幫助專案持續活躍下去。</p>
<p>基金會已正在準備預算，並且已經收到一些貢獻者的合作意向。我們計劃建立一個能負擔基金會行動支出以及開發成本的年度贊助商團隊。</p>
<p>我們的初始目標是確保有足夠三年的預算，使最低人手編制的人員可以全職地為狗狗幣專案貢獻，而不用擔心生計。</p>
<p>如果你願意支持狗狗幣基金會、有能力成為我們的主力贊助商，請與我們聯繫，我們很樂意與你聊聊。</p>
