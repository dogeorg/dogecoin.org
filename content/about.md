<div class="description">
The Foundation was established by members of the Dogecoin team in 2014 to provide
advocacy and support for the Dogecoin project. In 2021 the Foundation has been
re invigorated by members of the original core team along with fresh faces and new
seasoned advisors ready to grow Dogecoin for the decade ahead.

You can read about the Foundation's guiding principles in [The Dogecoin Manifesto](/manifesto).
