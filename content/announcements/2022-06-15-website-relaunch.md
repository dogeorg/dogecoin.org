Nine months ago we set about building a community group to overhaul the old
dogecoin.com website, and create a team who could collectively work on any
future websites for Dogecoin. 

After putting out the call for volunteers on Reddit and Twitter we gathered a 
group of around 20 Shibes with a wide variety of talents: from writing and 
translation, to HTML, CSS and graphic design. 

Since then the team, beginning with foundation.dogecoin.com developed a 
system for publishing, translating and maintaining websites for the Dogecoin
community. The next step was to apply that system to a full re-design of the 
dogecoin.com site.

Today we would love to welcome community feedback on the preview of the new 
website, which you can see at [preview.dogecoin.com](https://preview.dogecoin.com)

The translations are not all in place yet and there are some minor mobile issues,
however we're excited to get this out as a preview for a two week period to let
folk have a read through the "Dogepedia" articles, make suggestions via the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/dogecoinfoundation/dogecoin.com/issues)
system or even get involved.

If you're keen to be part of the website team reach out to Paulo (Inevitable360) 
for an invitation to the Discord server and the GitHub project.  You will need to
work with _git_ and _markdown_ however we've got some great community members who
are available to help explain the process.

A huge shout-out to all the people who have made this possible:

CB, Belle, Bluezr, Ella, Florian, Ishan, Sam, Michi, Misha, Paulo, Richard, Tim, 
Florian, Mishaboar, Dogememegirl, Adi, Doge Norway, Doge France, Bobdos, BeanieFi,
Claudiu05, CresentOdyssey, Dogespacewizard, Emon, Horizon, Lars, Mademeday, Memetaverse,
Rasoul, Yamazaki .. and anyone else we've missed! Thank you! 

-- The Web Team 


PS: You might be wondering where the developer focused content is, links to GitHub, how
to get involved etc.. we've actually secured the dogecoin.org domain and will be 
looking at how we can best use that as a 'Dogecoin Developer Portal' to accompany 
dogecoin.com as the 'Dogecoin User Portal'.
