## Dogecoin.com makeover.

Volunteers from the Doge Army have come together from all over the 
world to work on a re-design of the Dogecoin.com website. Bluezr, CB & 
Florian along with the amaze Hack Club teens Belle, Ella & Sam have been
building out a whole new site which has a stack of new information: 
from links to current projects and teams, to information on the network 
and how you can get involved as a coder, a miner, a HODLr or a fan!

## Dogepedia.

One of the key parts of the re-design will be the Dogepedia section. 
Good Shibes MishaBoar & Richard have scoured Reddit, Twitter and the 
net to compile a list of FAQs that can grow over time and become a real 
resource for the community. 

Our hope is that by making each Q&A a directly link-able page, we're 
arming the Doge Army with the tools to destroy FUD wherever they find
it!

## When Moon?

Expect to see a preview up in January for community feedback and 
if all is well, a shiny new website shortly after. Wow!
