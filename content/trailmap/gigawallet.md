## GigaWallet, an enterprise-ready dogecoin service for your platform.

As we've mentioned in the [Prologue](/trailmap/prologue), we believe that utility 
comes from adoption and adoption comes from utility, it's a feedback loop that is 
on the slow path right now due to friction around platform adoption. 

Many of the initiatives in this trailmap are focused on decreasing the cycle-time
for development, and smoothing the path for developers looking to integrate Dogecoin
into their platforms.

One key hurdle in this journey is the lack of a fit-for-purpose, drop in backend
service that any platform, exchange or retailer can run on their own infrastructure
that provides a modern non-custodial approach to processing Dogecoin transactions.

The GigaWallet project is an open-source initiative aimed at filling that gap by
providing a node / API solution that can be set up in seconds and allow a developer
to add Dogecoin transactions to their platform, as easily as they might with any
polished payment provider.

The GigaWallet aims to provide two levels of API, the first for processing and validating
traditional Dogecoin transactions, with a modern event-architecture ready to connect
with message queues and web APIs. The second will be APIs to integrate with the
proposed Dogecoin Keyring App & SDK. This is a mobile-first solution that will allow
platforms that use the GigaWallet to issue charges directly from their Apps to the 
Dogecoin Keyring App for approval by the user. This is important because it puts 
the ownership of keys back in the hands of the user, without removing a platform's 
ability to transact Dogecoin.

We believe that providing both halves of the solution as an open-source project, 
backend as well as ready-to-integrate mobile SDK for making Dogecoin payments, will
rapidly accelerate the uptake of Dogecoin by retailers, social media platforms, 
game developers and more.
