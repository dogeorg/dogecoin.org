We are Dogecoin, the accidental crypto-movement that makes people smile.

We are developing a currency for the people, </br>
and we strive to do only good everyday.</br>
Through this work we have come to value:

Being **useful**, we value *utility* over *technical brilliance*.</br>
Being **personable**, we value *individuals and interactions* over *profit-driven economics*.</br>
Being **welcoming**, we value *collaboration and trust* over *competition and exclusivity*.</br>
Being **reliable**, we value *working solutions* over *speed of delivery*. </br>

That is, while there is value in the items on</br>
the right, we value the items on the left more.
